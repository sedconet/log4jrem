Note: The file names depend on your version of Network Manager. For Network Manager 4.2 FP9 and FP10, the log4j version is 2.11.1. For FP11, FP12, and FP13, the log4j version is 2.11.2.

Note: Network Manager 4.2 FP13 does not contain the $NCHOME/precision/storm/apache-storm/external/storm-autocreds directory. After installing this test-fix in FP13, this folder will be created.


PREREQUISITE FIXES

This fix pack is applicable to IBM Tivoli Network Manager IP Edition 4.2 Fix Pack 9 (4.2-TIV-ITNMIP-FP00009) or later.


IMPORTANT NOTE

If you already have this fix installed and would like to upgrade to a newer fixpack, you must remove this testfix and restore the backed-upchanged files before you perform upgrade.	
	
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==========================

To install a Network Manager test fix, complete the following tasks:

1. Set the environment variables:
On Unix, source the $NCHOME/env.sh script to add the required binaries to your path.

2. Stop the Network Manager processes and ITNM Storm before installing a core test fix.

3. Back up and remove all the files(file name with older versions) that are listed in the CHANGED FILES section above. The test fix installer installs new versions of these files. New versions Keep the backed-up files. If you remove this test fix, or before you update to a new Fix Pack version, you must restore them.

4. To install a core test fix, run the following command:

ncp_perl ncp_testfix.pl -install <filepath> -core

where <filepath> is the full directory path and file name of the downloaded test fix file.


LISTING INSTALLED FIXES
=======================

To list the test fixes that were installed using the ncp_testfix script, complete the following steps:
1. Set the environment variables:
On Unix, source the $NCHOME/env.sh script to add the required binaries to your path.

2. Run the following command:

ncp_perl ncp_testfix.pl -list

Example output:

***********************************
***** List of installed APARs *****
***********************************

N/A

REMOVING A FIX
==============

To remove a test fix, complete the following steps:

1. Set the environment variables:
On Unix, source the $NCHOME/env.sh script to add the required binaries to your path.

2. Stop the Network Manager processes before removing a core test fix. Stop the Tivoli Integrated Portal before removing a GUI test fix.

3. To remove a core test fix, run the following command:

ncp_perl ncp_testfix.pl -remove <fixname> -core

where <fixname> is the name of the test fix as listed in the output when you list the installed fixes. Do not use the file name with the .tar, .gz or .zip extension for the name of the test fix. Do not include the directory path to the test fix file.  Use the name exactly as listed in the output of the ncp_testfix.pl -list command.

The following example removes the IV11528.Solaris.V39.32 core test fix:

ncp_perl ncp_testfix.pl -remove IV11528.Solaris.V39.32 -core

4. Restore the original libraries to their corresponding locations which were backed up during applying the testfix, as this scripts won't backup the old files and resotre during the installation/removal.
